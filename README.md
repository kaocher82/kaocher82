Hi there, I'm Kaocher Ahamed 👋

Hey, I'm a Certified Shopify Expert & Shopify developer who does more than just set up stores. I help brands grow, get faster, and make more sales. From custom checkouts to features Shopify doesn’t usually allow, I find ways to make it work.

I work with Shopify 2.0, custom builds, performance tuning, and ongoing store support. I also maintain several popular stores, keeping them fast, polished, and conversion-ready. My code follows best practices for SEO and speed to keep your store performing at its best.

Most of my clients come back and stay long term because I focus on real, maintainable results, not just checking boxes.

If Shopify feels limiting, let’s fix that. I'm here to help you build something better.


P.S. If your theme is buggy or was built by less experienced developers in the past, I may recommend a full rebuild to ensure long-term maintainability and seamless integration of new features.

I'm a freelancer with 10 years of experience in digital marketing and technology. As a Certified Shopify Expert, I help e-commerce entrepreneurs transform their stores into powerful sales engines by driving high-intent organic traffic, boosting conversion rates, and fixing the deep technical issues that hold them back from growth. Whether you're launching a new store or scaling an existing one, I provide a clear path to success.
